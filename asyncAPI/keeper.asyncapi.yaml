    Specification for the Keeper Backend Control Plane.

    - Publishes Commands: declarative spec (create/update reconciled by
    operator) and delete.

    - Spec subject includes database ID so only one message per database is
    relevant (newest wins).

    - Subscribes to Events (Status/Credentials)
